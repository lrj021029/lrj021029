- 👋 Hi, I’m jerry
- 👀 I'm interested in IT technology, games (especially open-world adventures), and discovering new music genres...
- 🌱 I've learned Python, C, HTML, JS, CSS — still coding like a noob but having a blast!
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on game mods, tiny web tools, or even silly tech experiments.
- 📫 How to reach me: Hit up my  email to: pbpvza1@gmail.com.
